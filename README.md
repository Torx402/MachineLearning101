# Introduction
This repo is my attempt at creating a detailed checklist of what goes into a machine learning project, from conception to final performance of the model, it contains everything. It is based on Aurelien Geron's excellent book, Hands-On Machine Learning. In chapter 2 of the book, it goes over a machine learning project from start to finish, which I believe serves a great starting point in tackling any machine learning project, and provides tips that can aid in all aspects of the project, from performance measure selection, to do custom transformation pipelines, and how to decide on a model, to tuning the parameters and finally testing the model on the data set, the chapter covers almost all the grounds needed in order to get a model up and running.

# Structure
The repo is divided into a few folders, the notes folder covers some theoretical background related to some concepts related to specific aspects of dealing with data. The main notebook where the project is implemented is available in the root directory. The dataset folder contains the dataset used in the project. Finally, the Cheat Sheet folder contains a notebook that lays out the checklist with notes regarding different scenarios one might face.
