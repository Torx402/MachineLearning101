In chapter 2 of the book, we will explore what going through a machine learning project from start to finish is like, we first begin by listing out the main steps that will be gone through:

* 1- Look At The Big Picture
* 2- Get the Data
* 3- Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights
* 4- Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms
* 5- Select a Model and Train it
* 6- Fine-tune Your Model
* 7- Present Your Solution
* 8- Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System

Each of these steps can be seen as a checklist to go through and consider your project, within each of these steps, there will be even more steps and checklists within them, but it is good to stay rather mindful of everything, so as to not miss anything or make colossal mistakes
